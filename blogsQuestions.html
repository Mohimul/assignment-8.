            <h5>1) What is the different of map, filter, forEach and find?</h5>
            <p>Ans: They all take a callback function as an argument and apply that function to each element in the array. However, each function has a different purpose and return value.
                <br>
                i)Map: The map function returns a new array with the same length as the original array. It does not modify the original array.
                <br>
                ii)Filter: The filter function returns a new array that contains only the elements.It does not modify the original array.
                <br>
                iii)ForEach: The forEach function calls the callback function once for each element in the array. It does not return a new array and does not modify the original array. <br>
                iv)Find: The find method takes a callback function as its argument that tests each element in the array. If a match is found, find() returns the matching element, otherwise, it returns undefined

            <h5>2) What is the different of localStorage, SessionsStorage and Cookies?</h5>
            <p>localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies are different ways to store data in the user's browser. <br>
                i) localStorage: localStorage is a web storage API that allows you to store key-value pairs in the user's browser with no expiration date. 
                <br>
                ii)SessionsStorage: sessionStorage is similar to localStorage, but the data stored using sessionStorage is specific to a browsing session. 
                <br>
                iii)Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are stored in the user's browser. Cookies are typically used to store user preferences or authentication information, such as a user's login credentials.
